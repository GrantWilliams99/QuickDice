# Overview

This is a simple digital version of the dice used primarily for playing Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop role-playing games. It simulates the seven most common dice for these games: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and D100 (D represents the number of sides the die has). There is also an eighth "custom" die which allows the user to select one of the seven aforementioned dice and enter in a number to roll it however many times they'd like. These eight choices are represented to the user with easy-to-use buttons. The top of the screen displays the total of the roll in addition to the die used and how many times it was rolled. 

I made this app for two reasons. I wanted to begin to learn how to make apps for Android, and I thought this was a simple enough exercise. I also wanted to enable my friends to play Dungeons and Dragons without either sharing my one set of dice (which would be a nightmare) or having them all buy their own and perhaps finding out they don't like the game. This simple app solves this conundrum.
